Division-Multiplication-Table-Trainer
=====================================

Learn your multiplication and division tables in no time at all.


Math, like any skill, requires practice to perfect!
Rather than take the time to practice, I made a browser-based game to help exercise my brain!

The concept is unbelievably simple: it "learns" which number families you excel or struggle with, then exercises the weaker ones more than the ones you already know. 

Let's say it asks "5 * 3"

Answer right, and the game will "learn" that you are strong with the number family 3,5,15, and in the future, it will "know" that you don't need practice with 15/5, 15/3, nor 3*5.

If you answer incorrectly, it will remember to give you extra practice with that number family later on.
It will also tell you how far under or over the correct answer you were. This helps to exercise the addition/subtraction families too!

Example:
Your answer is 2 greater than the correct answer.
[ OR ]
Your answer is 14 less than the correct answer.

Alternately, by turning off "Second Chance" mode, upon giving a wrong answer, the correct answer appears instantly, alongside its relatives, so that you quickly memorize the entire number family together.

On default difficulty, 6 is the highest number that will ever appear in a problem.
The difficulty slider/input(s) can be adjusted manually at any time, but there is no need to.
Once you have correctly answered every possible combination, the difficulty will automatically increase to 7 (and eventually 8, 9, etc...)
